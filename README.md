# Neural-Machine-Translation-using-Deep-Learning
Neural Machine Translation using Deep Learning Techniques to convert sentences from French to English


This project aims to develop machine translation deep learning model to translate French
language text to English language text. In Natural Language processing, Machine translation 
aims to translate one human native language to other human native language by training the
computers with machine learning algorithms. The model built for neural machine translation 
is encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes the French sentence into a fixed 
length vector from which a decoder generates a translation to English.

Model Architecture
In this model we used embedding layers and lstm layers for encoding and decoding the input 
text.
LSTM Architecture [10]
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is a special Recurrent Neural Network architecture, 
which was originally conceived by Hochreiter and Schmidhuber in 1997. This type of neural 
network has been recently rediscovered in the context of deep learning, because it is free 
from the problem of vanishing gradients, and offers excellent results and performance. The 
networks that are LSTM-based are ideal for prediction and classification of temporal 
sequences, and are replacing many traditional approaches to deep learning.
